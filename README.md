# PiTarget
The goal of this project is to design airsoft targets that are controlled centrally through a terminal-based program ran on the Raspberry Pi. The MQTT protocol is adopted to establish communication between the program and the targets, which are built using ESP32 micro-controllers. These micro-controllers communicate to the program via the MQTT broker hosted on the Raspberry Pi.
